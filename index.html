        <b>Schism Tracker</b> is a free and open-source reimplementation of <a
        href="http://schismtracker.org/wiki/Impulse-Tracker">Impulse
        Tracker</a>, a program used to create high quality music without the
        requirements of specialized, expensive equipment, and with a unique
        "finger feel" that is difficult to replicate in part. The player is
        based on a highly modified version of the <a
        href="https://openmpt.org/legacy_software">ModPlug</a> engine, with a
        number of bugfixes and changes to <a
        href="http://schismtracker.org/wiki/Player-abuse-tests">improve IT
        playback</a>.

      <p class="box-last">
        Where Impulse Tracker was limited to i386-based systems running MS-DOS,
        Schism Tracker runs on almost any platform that <a
        href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a> supports, and has been
        successfully built for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
        AmigaOS, BeOS, and even <a
        href="http://www.wiibrew.org/wiki/Schism_Tracker">the Wii</a>. Schism
        will most likely build on any architecture supported by GCC4 (e.g.
        alpha, m68k, arm, etc.) but it will probably not be as well-optimized
        on many systems.
